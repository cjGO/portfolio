Watch Notebooks

1) Data Pre-processing
  -> Change currencies, update values for inflation, ...
  -> Missing Data
  -> Image cleanup

2) Train NLP network to perform Image to Caption 
  -> upload an image of a watch to generate an auction title and description
  
3) AutoEncoder for Unsupervised Learning
  -> Train an AE network to generate feature mappings to perform clustering
  
4) Price Estimator
  -> Regression model for estimated auction prices for a given watch image
     # Input : Image - MODEL -> Output : Realised Price
     # Input : Text(descripton) - MODEL -> Output : Realised Price
     # Input : Image, Text(descripton) - MODEL -> Output : Realised Price
     
5) Region Comparison
  -> Do similar watches sell for different prices based on their region? [see if the listed_currency
          predicts whether it sells for more or less than the estimated prices]

6) Value Projector
  -> Is there enough data for the most popular watches sold at auction in order to do a future value estimator?
        ; similar to stock price estimation
        ; RNN, LSTM neural networks
        
7) Image Perspective - Classifier
  -> Find the entries which have the most common image of the front of the watch facing forward on a white background
  
8) General Exploratory Data Analysis
